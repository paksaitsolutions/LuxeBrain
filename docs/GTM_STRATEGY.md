# LuxeBrain AI - Go-To-Market Strategy
**Copyright © 2024 Paksa IT Solutions**

**Goal: $1M ARR in 12 Months**

---

## 1. IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE (ICP)

### Perfect First 100 Customers

**Primary ICP: Growing Fashion DTC Brands**

```
Revenue: $50K - $500K/month
Orders: 500 - 5,000/month
Products: 200 - 2,000 SKUs
Platform: WooCommerce
Vertical: Women's fashion, accessories, modest wear
Geography: US, UK, Pakistan, UAE, India
Team Size: 2-10 people
Tech Savvy: Medium (can install WordPress plugins)
Pain: Manual work, low conversion, inventory waste
```

**Why This ICP?**
- Big enough to afford $99-$299/month
- Small enough to need automation (no dev team)
- High SKU count = more AI value
- Fashion = visual search, outfit matching work well
- Growing = willing to try new tools

### Customer Segments (Priority Order)

**Tier 1: Sweet Spot (60% of focus)**
- $100K-$300K/month revenue
- 1,000-3,000 orders/month
- 500-1,500 products
- **Target Plan**: Growth ($299/mo)
- **Why**: Perfect size, high LTV, low churn

**Tier 2: Starter Segment (30% of focus)**
- $50K-$100K/month revenue
- 500-1,000 orders/month
- 200-500 products
- **Target Plan**: Starter ($99/mo)
- **Why**: Volume play, upsell to Growth

**Tier 3: Enterprise (10% of focus)**
- $500K+/month revenue
- 5,000+ orders/month
- 2,000+ products
- **Target Plan**: Pro/Enterprise ($799+/mo)
- **Why**: High ACV, but longer sales cycle

### Who Should NOT Buy LuxeBrain

❌ **Stores doing <$30K/month**
- Can't afford $99/month
- Not enough data for AI
- High churn risk

❌ **Stores on Shopify/Magento**
- Wrong platform (WooCommerce only for now)
- Expansion later

❌ **B2B/Wholesale stores**
- Different buying patterns
- AI models not trained for this

❌ **Single-product stores**
- No cross-sell opportunity
- Limited AI value

❌ **Stores with <100 products**
- Not enough inventory for recommendations
- Better tools exist

### Why Focus Beats Volume

**Focused ICP = Higher Conversion**
- Tailored messaging: "Built for fashion brands like yours"
- Better case studies: Same vertical
- Product-market fit: Features match needs
- Lower CAC: Targeted ads, no waste

**Math**:
- Spray & pray: 1,000 leads × 2% conversion = 20 customers
- Focused: 200 leads × 15% conversion = 30 customers
- **Result**: 50% more customers, 80% less spend
