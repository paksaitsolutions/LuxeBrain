**Engagement**
- Dashboard views (Target: 3+/week per user)

**Decision**: If activation <60%, pause acquisition and fix onboarding

### Monthly Metrics (1st of Month Review)

**Revenue**
- MRR (Target: +20% MoM)
- New MRR (Target: $5K/month)
- Expansion MRR (Target: $2K/month)

**Retention**
- Gross churn (Target: <5%/month)

- 90-day retention (Target: >80%)

**Decision**: If churn >7%, pause growth and fix retention

### Red-Flag Metrics (Check Daily)

```
Formula: (Activated users / Signups) × 100

```

**Metric 5: CAC Payback Period**

Red Flag: >3 months
Action: Reduce CAC or increase ARPU
```
